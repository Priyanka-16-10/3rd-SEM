<p>Gentlemen of the Congress: Once more, as repeatedly before, the spokesmen of 
the Central Empires have indicated their desire to discuss the objects of war and the 
possible basis of a general peace. Parleys have been in progress at Brest-Litovsk between 
Russian representatives and representatives of the Central Powers to which the attention 
of all the belligerents has been invited for the purpose of ascertaining whether it may 
be possible to extend these parleys into a general conference with regard to terms of 
peace	and	settlement.	The	Russian	representatives	presented	not	only	a	perfectly	definite statement of the principles upon which they would be willing to conclude peace, but 
also	an	equally	definite	program	of	the	concrete	application	of	those	principles.	The	
representatives of the Central Powers, on their part, presented an outline of settlement 
which,	if	much	less	definite,	seemed	susceptible	of	liberal	interpretation	until	their	
specific	program	of	practical	terms	was	added.	That	program	proposed	no	concessions	at	
all, either to the sovereignty of Russia or to the preferences of the populations with 
whose fortunes it dealt, but meant, in a word, that the Central Empires were to keep 
every foot of territory their armed forces had occupied every province, every city, every 
point of vantage as a permanent addition to their territories and their power. It is a 
reasonable	conjecture	that	the	general	principles	of	settlement	which	they	at	first	suggested originated with the more liberal statesmen of Germany and Austria, the men who 
have begun to feel the force of their own peoplesâ€™ thought and purpose, while the concrete terms of actual settlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but 
to keep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The Russian representatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot entertain such proposals of conquest 
and	domination.	The	whole	incident	is	full	of	significance.	It	is	also	full	of	perplexity.	
With whom are the Russian representatives dealing? For whom are the representatives of 
the Central Empires speaking? Are they speaking for the majorities of their respective 
parliaments or for the minority parties, that military and imperialistic minority which 
has so far dominated their whole policy and controlled the affairs of Turkey and of the 
Balkan States which have felt obliged to become their associates in this war?</p>
